APRIORI
=======

This is an (not optimized) implementation of the "apriori" algorithm.

Input and output files are specified inside apriori.py, as are
support and confidence values.

By default, the algorithm will retrieve data from accidents_sample.dat,
and will create a file named "rules.dat" with all the generated rules.

The file accidents_sample.dat is a sample of 1000 lines extracted from
accidents dataset avaiable on this link: http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/
